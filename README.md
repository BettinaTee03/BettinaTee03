# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate final-year undergraduate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, on a journey to blend the worlds of data and technology to create impactful solutions. My interests span from diving into the depths of machine learning and deep learning, unraveling patterns to create a end-to-end solution.
